## Problems faced by Women ü•∫
Women face numerous challenges and issues in various aspects of their lives. At AADHYA, we strive to address these problems and provide solutions through our website. Here are some common problems faced by women and how we aim to solve them:<br/><br/>
1.Gender Inequality: Women often face discrimination and unequal treatment in various spheres, including education, employment, and leadership opportunities.
<br/><br/>
2. Lack of Empowerment: Many women struggle with low self-esteem, lack of confidence, and a sense of disempowerment. 
<br/><br/>
3. Limited Access to Resources: Women may face difficulties in accessing essential resources such as education, healthcare, legal support, and financial services. 
<br/><br/>
4. Gender-Based Violence: Women often experience various forms of gender-based violence, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, and assault. 
<br/><br/>
5. Lack of Representation: Women's voices are often marginalized or underrepresented in decision-making processes, media, and other platforms.
<br/><br/>

## How we solved it ‚úÖ

4. Gender-Based Violence: We address these issues through informative blog articles that shed light on the prevalence of such violence, offer support and resources for survivors, and advocate for prevention and intervention strategies. <br/><br/>
5. Lack of Representation:  At AADHYA, we provide a space for women to share their stories, perspectives, and experiences through our blogs and community chat.

## Prerequisites üë®‚Äçüíª

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Cloning and Running the Application in local üíª

Clone the project in localhost
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manmohan63/Project-Durga.git
```
Install all the npm packages. Go into the web folder and type the following command to install all npm packages

```bash
npm install
```



In order to run the application in development mode type the following command

```bash
yarn dev
```

The Application Runs on **localhost:3000**

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## How we built it üßë‚Äçüíª
1. Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications. Next.js provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features that enhance performance and improve SEO. <br/><br/>
2. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be combined to create custom and responsive designs. <br/><br/>

These technologies were chosen for AADHYA due to their combination of flexibility, ease of use, and robustness. Next.js provides a solid foundation for building complex web applications, while Tailwind CSS streamlines the UI development process.
